SUPERSTRUCTURES offers you the opportunity to help preserve the buildings and infrastructure of the greatest city in the world, while advancing the art and science of restoration.,
 
Our expertise extends to all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls, to VIP roofing panels.  We've won numerous prestigious awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region. ,

We offer career opportunities at a variety of levels for architects and structural engineers who share our dedication to our mission.,

If your passion and competence align with our area of practice, this is truly one of the best places you can work. In fact, a significant fraction of our office staff has been recruited by existing staff members.,

We work in teams assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. You’ll enjoy the dual advantages of a ""small office” experience coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. ,

Staff members typically participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion.  You'll have the opportunity to see the designs you draw executed in the field, and you'll take on greater responsibility and client exposure as soon as you are ready.,
 
You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, high resolution image capture (some of it drone based), and state of the art non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. ,

Frequent lunchtime seminars by industry experts, including our own, keep us current on developments in the profession (with the additional benefit of free lunch).,
 
We are committed to a work / life balance, and to a work week of 40 hours. When, on occasion, more than 40 hours are required, you’ll be compensated for every additional hour worked. Our benefits include paid holidays, vacation and sick days, health insurance for employee and family, 401(k), a continuing education allowance, and free NYC MetroCards., 

Our Tribeca location is one of New York City's most convenient and vibrant, easily accessible via public transportation. Our light-filled office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and drop dead views in three directions - not a bad place to spend the workday.,

We are a four-year-old medical technology company founded by a team of accomplished entrepreneurs that have built multiple successful, multi-million-dollar companies, including two that we took public on the NASDAQ.  ,
This company is growing rapidly and has been well funded, having raised $14.5 million dollars to date.  ,
,
We have created and patented a revolutionary orthopedic rehabilitation device.  Response to the new device has been very strong, with endorsement by 126 highly respected surgeons nationwide.  First versions of the device have been sold into more than 75 hospitals and clinics including many of the top 20 organizations in the country.  ,
We are now nearing completion of our second product, a portable version of our first flagship device.  A growing list of surgeons are pre-ordering the product in anticipation of launch this spring.,
,
The new product features wearable devices for measuring and tracking patient progress.,
We are now seeking a full-time VP of Engineering (near Boston or surrounding area), with a proven track record of successfully bringing new medical devices from specs to market. This person will report directly to our CEO and manage a small team of mechanical, electrical, and software engineers, industrial designers, and fabricators which will turn pictures, drawings, specs, illustrations, directions and requirements into a working, market-ready device; and hand it off to manufacturing.,
,
The company is located in western Connecticut.  This candidate must be located either in Boston or western Connecticut, or nearby enough that they can easily commute there for meetings.  Alternatively the company will consider relocating a very qualified candidate.,
,
The current product is being finalized and tested for market readiness.  Another device is in early stages of engineering, and there are multiple additional products planned behind these.  For the right candidate, there are likely to be many years of engineering work ahead.,
,
The desired candidate will oversee and manage each contributing engineer on timelines and budgets. The VP of Engineering drives the planning, design, prototyping, testing, and refinement of product development.,
,
The highest quality we are seeking is the ability to make things go right to get high quality work done with very aggressive targets.  The ideal candidate has:,
,
•	 an entrepreneurial, “guerilla warfare” mindset and style, i.e. builds things fast and cheap and demonstrates them quickly, versus big-company-big-budget-long-timeline; ,
•	an extreme sense of urgency; ,
•	a high level of creativity and a vast knowledge of a wide variety of materials and methods of solving engineering problems; ,
•	an ability to plan activities and processes in parallel; ,
•	and a positive “get it done” “this will be easy” attitude; ,
•	combining to push projects to completion at rapid speed.,
The candidate should be familiar with and operate with lean and agile best practices with frequent builds, and with creating a minimum viable product as first priority.,
The Engineering Manager will need to:,
•	Assess proposals and identify any additional partners/consultants needed for key aspects of the design, testing, and manufacturing processes,
•	Manage diverse teams of engineers and designers,
•	Keep detailed and accurate records,
•	Cooperate with and support quality management system for regulatory requirements,
